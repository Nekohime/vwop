# vwop

Incomplete. Works but prims are not yet handled.

mkdir ./paths/

ln -s /var/www/html/3d/{models,rwx,textures} {models,rwx,textures}

./run.sh

## The Plan

- Simple code to follow
- No Remote Paths
- Flat Prims
- Possibly: 3D Prims
- Caching of prims
- Supporting both zipped (/models/) and unzipped (/rwx/, for WideWorlds) modes. At least until WideWorlds loads zipped models.
